    <h2>Why I joined <b>The Growth Company</b> Bootcamp</h2>
    <p>I joined The Growth Company Bootcamp after previously completing a taster course. I thoroughly enjoyed the this and wanted to definitely expand my knowledge!

    <h2>My Targets & Progress</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 
            <h4>My confidence</h4>
            <p>I often struggle to speak infront of a group whether it be presenting a presentation or asking for help with something. I am progressing towards improving my confidence by asking more questions when I am struggling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>My general coding knowledge</h4>
            <p>I am working towards this by doing extra work and research outside of class</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Organisation skills</h4>
            <p>I am working towards this by trying to make sure I keep my VSCode folders as neatly as possible and making sure my code is also readable</p>
